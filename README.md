# Ventoy CPIO

NOTE: This is just a small part of my attempt to add a sane(-ish) build system
to Ventoy.

## Notes

- [In GCC terms](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Configure-Terms.html):
  - The build is assumed to be x86_64 *nix
  - The host (for ventoy installation tools) is assumed to be x86_64
  - The targets are x86_64, i386, aarch64 and mips64el
